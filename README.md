# **This is a browser extension**

written to type a word automatically in the minigame bombparty at jklm.com.

*It spawns a panel on the left on which there are the **Try** button (to type a word on your turn),*
*the **IT**/**EN** language switch,*
*and the **reset** button, (to remove already used words of a round from the blacklist when you start a new round)*

## **USAGE**

Open the extension tab for your, check the box for developers and load the non-packed extension.

To work properly, the browser must be started with cross-scripting protection disabled, or it won't work.

*For example, Google Chrome must be started like this:*

```
"C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --args --disable-web-security --user-data-dir="[chose a path]"
```

**When you will be playing, just press on *try* once to get the word automatically.**

*Remember to reset when the round ends to delete blacklisted already used words.*
